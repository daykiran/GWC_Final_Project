      <h1>Vismark Juarez</h1>

      <p>Where do you work?</p>
      <pre>
      AT&T.
      </pre>
      <p>Where do you work? Describe your current position, and your career path that led to it. How long have you been in this position?</p>
      <pre>
      Software Engineer at AT&T - I work primarily in the Cybersecurity space supporting the company's Chief Security Office
      and have been in this role for 2 years.
      </pre>
      <p>What is your racial identity?</p>
      <pre>
      Hispanic.
      </pre>
      <p>Do you identify as any other minorities that you see as relevant to how you are identified within your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      None.
      </pre>
      <blockquote>Hispanics are largely underrepresented in STEM-related fields, but the demographic is also growing within the field</blockquote>
      <p>Would you consider your workplace diverse?</p>
      <pre>
      Yes -- a wide array of cultures and backgrounds are reflected in the diversity of the company.
      </pre>
      <p>Is your race a minority within your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      Yes. Hispanics are largely underrepresented in STEM-related fields, but the demographic is also growing within the field.
      </pre>
      <p>How do you think your race/status as a minority is viewed within the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      I'd say Hispanics in Software Engineering roles are still largely seen as outliers, and out-of-the-norm. Nonetheless, I see this changing
      in the near future with the onset of easily-accessible STEM-education opportunities for all. The internet and Massively Online Open Classrooms
      (MOOCS) have lowered the bar to entry for individuals to break into Software Engineering via self-study. A rapidly changing 21st-century tech
      revolution has underscored the importance of STEM education for middle-school and high-school students internationally, and is at the center of
      discussions surrounding curriculum reform within the U.S. and outside of it -- and this is impactful for all demographics.
      </pre>
      <p>How much do you agree with the following statement: I am conscious of my race in my workplace.</p>
      <pre>
      I agree, but only to the extent where cultural and ethnic differences between me and my colleagues are celebrated. I am fortunate to work in
      such a diverse company where differences in thought and life-experiences serve as learning opportunities, and avenues for bringing people
      together.
      </pre>
      <p>Could you talk about a time where you strongly identified with this statement?Could you talk about a time where you strongly did not identify with this statement?</p>
      <pre>
      I am reminded of my background -- and the backgrounds of my colleagues -- as well as the positive impact our differences make, every day. We all
      share a common set of ideals and objectives: to work together efficiently and effectively in order to deliver quality results to stakeholders.
      Differences in perspective or identity do not interfere with these objectives; they help promote them. These differences serve as a fresh
      perspective; a different way of tackling the same problem, and may even shed light into a problem I didn't know was there. So, differences between
      me and my colleagues is always something worthy of embracing and I cannot think of a time I thought otherwise.

      <blockquote class="brooks">
        I think all developers -- irrespective of background or ethnicity -- have a social responsibility to help train potential STEM workers.
      </blockquote>
      <p>What do you think needs to be changed about how people view P.O.C. in S.T.E.M. fields? What can you personally do to change this perception?</p>
      <pre>
      I think more opportunities need to be afforded to underrepresented groups in STEM. This would increase the number of traditionally
      underrepresented groups in the field. Girls who Code, Hack the Hood and volunteering at the middle-school and high-school level are
      just a few important efforts that aim to improve these stats.
      </pre>
      <p>What do you wish more white allies did to support P.O.C. in the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      I think all developers -- irrespective of background or ethnicity -- have a social responsibility to help train potential STEM workers.
      STEM fields have often been stigmatized as being fields in which only a select few can thrive in, but if current STEM employees found time
      to help mentor and inspire younger generations--as well as people inclined to make a career switch -- STEM workforce demographics would become
      slightly more in tune with the demographics of the population at-large.
      </pre>
      <p>Have you ever experienced a microaggression or macro aggression in your workplace/school?</p>
      <pre>
      I have been called an ethnic slur on one occasion during college by a drunk party-goer, and have also been told I "don't belong here" by a
      homeless man in a dark sidewalk one night-- also while in college in Washington D.C. I have never experienced discrimination at the workplace.
      </pre>
      <p>How often do you experience this?</p>
      <pre>
      I'm fortunate enough to not experience microaggressions on a regular basis. I've very rarely experienced microaggressions.
      </pre>
      <p>Could you talk about an experience(with micro/macro aggressions)that especially represents your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      I have been called an ethnic slur on one occasion during college by a drunk party-goer, and have also been told I "don't belong here" by a
      homeless man in a dark sidewalk one night.
      </pre>
      <p>What advice would you give to a P.O.C. in a similar situation?</p>
      <pre>
      I've found that people who harbor discriminatory notions toward others are simply misinformed. I don't think these people are bad people -- they
      simply have a limited span of experience to draw upon when thinking of people who do not look, worship or behave like they do. As such, I
      think it's important to navigate these situations with caution, empathy and understanding -- not fear, anger -- or much less - violence. In the
      aforementioned situations, I ignored the offensive comments. I think a better approach would have been to correct the offensive remarks by
      explaining why the comments were offensive in an attempt to change the person's mindset.
      </pre>
      <p>What do you think is the first step to getting more P.O.C. in the S.T.E.M. field? Why is it important to increase diversity in the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      I think the first step in getting more P.O.C in STEM is to foster and support initiatives that promote inclusivity in STEM (like Girls Who Code!).
      It's the responsibility of all socially-conscious STEM workers to do so. Increasing diversity in STEM is needed in order to continue to spur
      innovation, and develop new technologies with the needs of all members of society in mind.
