        <p1>SHEILA REED</p1> is an associate director at AT&T. In this interview, Reed describes her experiences as a black women in tech.
      </p2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Could you give a description of your current occupation?</p>
      <pre>
      As the associate director of Metrics and Analytics, I manage a team that compiles data-training for the training
      organization at our company. Our work shows the impact of training new employees as professional business workers
      that can take client requests and fulfill them. For example, we have a training program to help workers learn how
      to sell products successfully. My team measures the impact of the training by seeing how they perform after the
      training. Showing the impact training tells the company whether or not it’s worth the money and time they
      are putting into the program.
      </pre>
      <p>Could you talk about your career path that led you to your current position?</p>
      <pre>
      The first few years after I graduated, I was an industrial engineer. There were opportunities in training and I
      enjoyed those a lot. I was working as an industrial engineer but taking training opportunities as well. I started
      at Ameritech(AT&T), as a process engineer. I managed multiple processes for the billing system. I started to
      transition to training within a year or so. Eventually I transferred into the training organization. That was
      probably four, five years into it. I wasn’t in the role of training people, there were trainers, but I was managing
      the instructors and designers who executed the training. I eventually moved into a project management position.
      When I left the management role, I moved into my current position.
      </pre>
      <p>How long have you been in your current position?</p>
      <pre>
      Five years.
      </pre>
      <p>What is your racial identity?</p>
      <pre>
      African-American.
      </pre>
      <p>Do you identify as any other minorities that you see as relevant to how you are identified within your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      Female.
      </pre>
      <aside class="pquote">
        <blockquote>
          <p>I get a lot of 'you're different'. Different from what?</p>
        </blockquote>
      </aside>
      <p>Would you consider your workplace diverse?</p>
      <pre>
      Yes.
      </pre>
      <p>Is your race a minority within your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      Yes.
      </pre>
      <p>How do you think your race/status as a minority is viewed within the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      It can be viewed in the stereotypical manner. I get a lot of ‘you’re different”. Different from what?
      </pre>
      <p>How much do you agree with the following statement: I am conscious of my race in my workplace.</p>
      <pre>
      On a scale of 1-10, it’s nine, probably 10.
      </pre>
      <p>Could you talk about a time where you strongly identified with this statement?</p>
      <pre>
      There were a couple situations, when I started in a corporate environment, as an engineer, I was very often the
      only black female, sometimes the only black person. It was very obvious in social situations, when I was invited--
      but I was the only person of color who was invited--it was probably because I was the only person of color in
      that section of the company. That’s changed over time or I’ve gotten more comfortable. Now it’s more diverse,
      there are more women. At AT&T we have become a more diverse environment.
      </pre>
      <p>What do you think needs to be changed about how people view P.O.C. in S.T.E.M. fields?</p>
      <pre>
      The perception that people of color don’t have the same level of intelligence. The perception that ‘oh, you’re a
      person of color, we probably had a quota that we needed to meet, so you probably got special treatment because
      ‘we needed you’” Our society has changed too, because there was a time where there were required racial quotas,
      because we had to force companies to be more diverse. People would think that because of the quota, you weren’t
      as qualified as someone else. Because I’m black, my credibility and qualifications are always doubted. One of
      the first jobs out of college, I went to headquarters and I was asked ‘are you here for the secretary position’,
      I said that I was here for the engineering position--there was  a look of surprise. They knew who was coming in
      that day, but they just assumed.

      </section>
      <p>What can you personally do to change this perception?</p>
      <pre>
      I’m not sure.
      </pre>
      <p>What do you wish more white allies did to support P.O.C. in the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      I have had white allies, within the last six years. I had a white female boss, who advocated for me when they were
      going to move me to Dallas and I didn’t want to move because my father was sick at the time. She advocated for me
      so I didn’t have to move to Dallas with my sick father. She also advocated for me when the clients weren’t satisfied
      with what the company had done, and she helped me get the clients’ approval.
      </pre>
      <p>Have you ever experienced a microaggression or macro aggression in your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      I’m thinking that I have. For sure, actually.
      </pre>
      <p>How often do you experience this?</p>
      <pre>
      I don’t think it happens a lot, I just think it happens because people are rude or they feel the need to stand out.
      </pre>
      <p>Could you talk about an experience(with micro/macro aggressions)that especially represents your workplace?</p>
      <pre>
      I had a boss once who was unnecessarily aggressive and he was like that to everyone. At that time he said some things
      to me, and I said that I wasn’t willing to accept that. I had a one-on-one with him and called him out on it, telling
      him that even though if what he was saying was valid, he could not belittle me in the process. He was very surprised
      that I confronted him. He didn’t do it afterwards.
      </pre>
      <p>What advice would you give to a P.O.C. in a similar situation?</p>
      <pre>
      One of the things that I've learned, is that you have to address it with the person if you can. Not necessarily in
      a group environment, cause they might not respond truthfully out of embarrassment. Share with them your
      observations without accusing them, because sometimes people don’t realize it when they do, it’s almost unconscious.
      If you have that one-on-one conversation, ‘they know that you know’. Sometimes people do it because they can
      get away with it, but when you have that one-on-one conversation, you call them on it, it gives them a decision of
      whether to continue or stop. Even if they continue they might think about more than they had done before.

      </div>
      <p>What do you think is the first step to getting more P.O.C. in the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      Exposure. The program what you’re doing is excellent, especially free programs. It needs to be done at a younger
      age. If you live in an environment where you don’t have examples, you won’t know what is possible or what exists
      because you’ve never been exposed to those things before. Exposing young children to S.T.E.M. in a way that is
      fun will plant the seed that S.T.E.M. exists and maybe they want to do it in the future. Sometimes you have
      teachers who are biased, and won’t encourage kids of color to show interest in math and science. Teachers who
      recommend lower math classes to people of color with no logical reason are a perfect example of that. Many
      parents can’t push their children into higher classes and get them into better opportunities. Involvement for
      parents as an advocate, especially  in environments where teachers don’t support their students of color. People
      need to know about the existence and all the opportunities and positions that are within the S.T.E.M. field.
      </pre>
      <p>Why is it important to increase diversity in the S.T.E.M. field?</p>
      <pre>
      It fosters different perspectives, and those lead to better solutions. With multiple perspectives you get the
      value of those diff in a better solution. On my team, if everyone thinks like me, then it’s not gonna work,
      but if someone sees things differently, the product is always better. Having different opinions and insight
      is a good thing. It’s the best interest of companies and schools and everywhere to encourage that diversity.
